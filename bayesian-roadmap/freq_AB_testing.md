## Conversion Metrics

Q - 

Why is it helpful to practice applying a working case definition of a conversion to existing data?

- It helps you see if you want to revise the case definition in order to measure conversions most accurately in your experiment.

​          Feedback        

​          Finalizing your working definition through trying to apply it  is a great way to ensure that conversions are measured accurately  throughout your experiment.     

Q -   

Limitations of experimenting with increasing conversions is that some conversions are harder to measure than others, there are multiple ways to measure the same conversion, and `_____`.   

Limitations of  experimenting with increasing conversions is that some conversions are  harder to measure than others, there are multiple ways to measure the  same conversion, and `_____`.

- it can be a stretch to link the literal meaning of the conversion with the conceptual meaning

​          Feedback        

​          This is correct, and is a common problem cited in terms of  social media, where increasing engagement conversions may not always  also increase sales conversions.        



Q - 

What should conversions be linked to, both conceptually and logically?

- defined objectives (such as marketing objectives)

​          Feedback        

​          Conversions are concepts - so they need to be conceptually and logically linked to defined objectives such as marketing objectives so  that they can be measured and tested in the experiment.

- Conversion rates allow for fair comparisons across different time periods and scenarios.

​          Feedback        

​          When you create a conversion rate, with conversions in the  numerator over an applicable denominator, you can fairly compare rates  across time periods and different scenarios, like marketing a  distribution channels.        

Q - 

It is easier to set a target in your experiment to increase a `_____` compared to setting a target to increase a `_____`,

- rate; frequency

​          Feedback        

​          Rates are more stable than frequencies, and understanding  their behavior over time is much more informative than studying a  frequency over time.

Q -

Since conversion rates are sensitive to what denominator is chosen, what is a typical strategy to deal with this sensitivity?

- Choose more than one denominator so you can make more than one rate to examine.

​          Feedback        

​          Since measuring conversions for numerators is more  straightforward than selecting and measuring denominators, using  multiple denominators to make multiple rates is helpful for  interpretation.        

Q -

What can be a common problem with choosing a denominator in a conversion rate?

- It may be difficult to ensure that every conversion represented in the numerator is also represented in the denominator.

​          Feedback        

​          This can be a common problem, especially when trying to use easily available data.        

Q -

What does misclassification lead to?

 You are correct!      

- inaccurate conversion rates

​          Feedback        

​          Misclassifying a conversion as not a conversion (or vice  versa), or misclassifying whether or not a unit belongs in the  denominator, will lead to inaccurate conversion rates.        

Q - 

What happens when you operationalize and document a conversion?

 You are correct!      

- You decide exactly how you are going to measure the conversion in the experiment, and you write down those plans.

​          Feedback        

​          It is important you do this before starting the experiment so  you can ensure you can measure the conversion accurately during the  experiment, and do not forget how to do that.        

Q - 

If a sentinel event undercounts a conversion, how can it be helpful to track?          

 You are correct!      

- It will be proportional to the actual conversion, so if it goes up or down, you can assume the conversion went up or down.

​          Feedback        

​          Sentinel events are proportional to the conversion, so changes in the frequencies of sentinel events suggest changes in the  frequencies of actual conversions.        

Q -

How is an application flow diagram helpful when identifying and prioritizing conversions?

 You are correct!      

- It helps you consider the entire universe of potential conversions from which you could select your measurements.

​          Feedback        

​          By listing all the potential customer actions on the diagram,  you can consider which actions you want to prioritize and count as  conversions.

Q - 

Why is it important to know the baseline rate before you design an experiment intended to increase it?

 You are correct!      

- so you set a reasonable target rate

​          Feedback        

​          If your baseline rate is already high, you have less room for improvement than in if your baseline rate is low.        

Q-

After your baseline analysis, you can plan a campaign right away if `_____`.

 You are correct!      

- you see a change that can be made that you are pretty sure will increase your conversion rates compared to baseline

​          Feedback        

​          It is best to optimize your system by making known, positive  changes prior to engaging in experiments that can only bring incremental change.        

Q -

Considering baseline results for a conversion rate for the A condition can help you `_____`.

 You are correct!      

- set reasonable goals for the conversion rate for the B condition

​          Feedback        

​          Since an experimental condition will likely not improve your  rates that much, it is helpful to see baseline rates so you can set  reasonable goals.

Q- 

In a chi-square test, what does the "observed" table represent?     

 You are correct!      

- the contingency table containing the data you collected or "observed"

​          Feedback        

​          The "observed" table has the real data, and the "expected"  table has data calculated based on the marginals in the observed table.        

Q -

If you want to know the range in which the population-level value is, compute `_____`. If you want to know if, in a contingency table, row status is associated with column status, compute `_____`.     

 You are correct!      

- confidence intervals; a chi-square test

​          Feedback        

​          Because confidence intervals give you ranges, they are not as  useful as a chi-square test in telling if your two conditions are  associated with conversions.        

Q -

What does a confidence interval represent?

 You are correct!      

- A  range of numbers around a point estimate derived from a sample within  which we have statistical confidence is the true, population-level  estimate.

​          Feedback        

​          It is possible to measure a point estimate in a sample, then  calculate a confidence interval around that point estimate to make an  estimate of a range in which the population-level estimate is likely to  fall.        

Q - 

To plan a timeline for the experiment, it is helpful to use estimates from `_____`.    

- baseline data and sample size calculation

​          Feedback        

​          Using baseline estimates of the denominator, you can calculate how many time periods you need to run your experiment until you get the total of your sample size calculation.        

Q - 

Why did we use the Excel simulator when also using G*Power?  

- to figure out what probabilities to enter in G*Power's determine window

​          Feedback        

​          The simulator helped us set up a reasonable possible scenario  for condition B so we could enter estimated probabilities into G*Power.        

Q - 

How does G*Power work? 

- You choose the test you will do from the dropdown box, enter values, hit  "calculate", and it calculates the values you want (including sample  size).

​          Feedback        

​          If you want it to calculate sample size, you choose that as  one of the output values. However, if you have a desired sample size,  you can enter that, and it will calculate other parameters as output  values.

Q -

What two things should you weigh against each other when considering acting on the results of your experiment?

- the cost of changing to the B condition vs. the costs of not changing to the B condition

​          Feedback        

​          The whole experiment was to guide you to decide if the cost of changing to B would be worth it, and conversely, if the cost of NOT  changing to B would be unacceptab

## Inference vs Making Decisions 

 In academia we often care about a estimating some unknown quantity In industry, we are often interested in making a decision, not just estimating unknowns Decisions need to account for decision maker's preference for risk and take into account exogenous costs and benefits Decision problem is logically separate from the inference task. Why? You *do not want to* evaluate utility at the average values  of the parameters; instead evaluate the utility at each value of the  parameters and then average it. Why?
